# About This Repository

This repository contains a library of [Golgi](https://github.com/robtweed/golgi) WebComponents that
can be used as building blocks to implement user interfaces inspired by the
[SBAdmin](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-5-admin-template-sb-admin/) User Interface model.

# Dependencies

This Component Library has three dependencies:

- [Golgi](https://github.com/robtweed/golgi)
- [The Bootstrap 5 Runtime](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [The Feather icon library](https://feathericons.com/)

Note that the *golgi-sbadmin* WebComponents use Shadow DOM and are therefore self-contained in terms of styling,
so the standard Bootstrap 5 stylesheet is not needed.

# Getting Started

See the [*/examples*](./examples) folder in this repository.

You'll find a fully worked example that you can copy to your Web Server.
